 We activate each partnership with tailored promotions and keep benefits “always on” through the partner’s internal or external channels. This helps ensure visibility and continuous traffic.
 
 We also provide monthly reports with key metrics such as usage of the benefit, traffic driven, sales generated, and the top courses purchased. This data-driven approach helps us keep partners engaged, prove ROI, and identify new opportunities together.
 
 Finally, we strengthen trust and retention by collaborating on co-branded initiatives like workshops, certifications, or joint campaigns. This allows partners not only to promote learning but also to showcase their brand as part of our students’ education journey.","One area that still needs improvement is partner communication and activation in markets where our brand is less recognized. While we provide ongoing benefits and campaigns, partners sometimes deprioritize communication as they manage multiple offerings for their audiences.
 
 Another area is ensuring consistent tracking and reporting. Not all partners use our tracking links or tools, which limits visibility into true performance. We’re working on building stronger processes and incentives to improve adoption.","Over the past two years, our strategy has shifted from purely discount-driven partnerships to a model that emphasizes co-branding, certification, and community engagement.
 
 We realized that driving revenue through partnerships requires more than just offering benefits. By having companies certify our courses, co-host workshops, or integrate into our platform, we create tangible value and trust for students while giving partners deeper brand visibility and talent pipelines.
 
 This evolution was driven by the need to increase brand awareness in competitive markets and to ensure partnerships contribute not only to sales but also to long-term positioning.","AI will fundamentally change the way we design partnerships. With our upcoming AI-powered platform, we can personalize learning paths in real time, ensuring that partner content, tools, or certifications are always up to date and relevant.
 
 This means partners can integrate more seamlessly into the student journey, with content refreshed in hours instead of months. AI also allows us to identify patterns in student demand and propose collaborations with partners that directly match market needs.
 
 Ultimately, AI enables partnerships to move from transactional to dynamic and adaptive relationships, where value for students and partners is continuously optimized.","We see partnerships as one of the most powerful drivers of growth for EdTech. At Coderhouse, partnerships already account for a significant share of new students and revenue, but more importantly, they allow us to bridge companies, talent, and education in a scalable way.
 
 We’d love to see more industry benchmarks and case studies around partnerships not just as sales channels, but as strategic levers for trust, talent development, and brand building."

Gong, the LLMs, etc have certainly taken steps in that direction. In partnerships I feel like there's a need for ""alignment"" on how to use AI together, and that becomes a cultural/technological exchange we'd have to work through inside of each partnership.",

 Co-sell alignment through account mapping and opportunity sharing helps drive sourced and influenced revenue.
 
 Partner events and town halls create strong engagement and visibility.
 
 Tools like the PRM, playbooks, and co-marketing resources make it easier for partners to access what they need.
 
 Executive and field involvement keeps top partners aligned and supported.","We need to scale faster — current resourcing creates bottlenecks in onboarding, enablement, and co-sell support.
 
 Processes are still too manual; more automation is needed across PRM, reporting, and license workflows.
 
 Communication and visibility for mid-tier partners could be stronger, so they feel supported without heavy 1:1 time.
 
 Our partner portal is improving but still lacks the seamless experience and depth of resources partners expect.
 
 Better alignment is needed between marketing, sales, and product teams to deliver a more consistent partner experience.","We formalized our partner program with clear tiers, onboarding journeys, and certification requirements.
 
 We invested in technology like PRM, Crossbeam, and enablement platforms to automate processes and provide more visibility.
 
 Our focus expanded from just channel resale to a broader mix of solution partners, ISVs, and marketplace relationships.
 
 Engagement moved from one-off activities to consistent programs — roadshows, partner town halls, co-marketing, and advisory boards.
 
 What drove these changes:
 
 Executive alignment on partnerships as a core revenue lever.
 
 The need to scale globally while improving partner experience.
 
 Demand from partners for more enablement, co-sell support, and predictable processes.
 
 Market growth opportunities that require ecosystem collaboration rather than direct selling alone.","It can personalize enablement and recommendations for each partner, tailoring content, training, and plays to their maturity and focus.
 
 AI can give partners real-time insights into market trends, customer needs, and integration opportunities, making them more consultative and valuable to customers.
 
 It could reshape co-selling by analyzing data across ecosystems to surface the best joint opportunities and predict win likelihood.
 
 AI-driven support tools can help partners troubleshoot faster, deliver higher-quality implementations, and increase customer satisfaction.
 
 Longer term, AI may open new business models where partners package Celigo solutions with their own IP or industry expertise in smarter, more scalable ways.","Partnerships are core to our growth strategy, and we’ve made significant progress in building a more structured, scalable, and partner-friendly program. Our biggest focus now is balancing growth with resources, continuing to automate processes, expand enablement, and improve partner experience while driving measurable revenue impact. Continued investment in partner operations and technology will be key to sustaining momentum."

We also unified the two partner teams in to one team to drive the ecosystem synergies that will help all partnerships grow.,"We are still learning and experimenting with how AI will help our partner ecosystem. Some partners have adopted our solutions with their own AI services to create unique offerings to jointly take to market. These programs are in early stages right now, so the ROI effectiveness can't be measured yet.","The Channel ecosystem revenues continue to grow and all vendors want to be part of the growth. To be part of the growth, leadership needs to invest in the resources just like they do in direct sales and marketing. Hopefully this survey can help bring that gap."
